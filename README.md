# Task2-TuteDude
Task1: Check whether a number is even or odd.
To determine this, we divide the number by 2 and check the remainder to see if it's equal to 0. If yes, the number is even else it's an odd number.


Task2:
Calculate the total sum of numbers from 1 to 50 and display the result. 
To determine this, we ran a for loop from 1 to 51 in range and then added them to the sum which provided the total sum of all the numbers in the range of 1 to 50.
